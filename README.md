Silky Shark was created as another solution to enable mouse smoothing or stabilization for applications and web canvases that do not natively support smoothing or stabilization.

Being mostly a personal project at the time, this software operates on the notion of "<i>it works fine for me</i>". It will probably help if you have .NET updated, Windows 10, a Wacom or similar tablet that has the option to disable Windows/Micrsoft Ink, and have a relatively decent rig. There is no guarantee this will work for everyone given the nature of performance, hardware, and software discrepancies across systems.

Unfortunately I offer little to no technical support for this software aside from what you will find in the help document. If you need a more personalized solution you are welcome to modify the source code. Silky Shark is free to use and open source software.
